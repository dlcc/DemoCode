# Utility projects for WPF

This directory contains utility projects which I (Jon Skeet) have
found useful in multiple WPF apps. I make no claim that they're
*generally* useful, and they're certainly not curated with the same
level of detail I'd apply in a more formal setting.

You're welcome to fetch the code here and build it; it's unlikely
that I'll publish it on NuGet any time soon.
